        <h3>Sony A90J OLED SmartTV</h3>
        <p>The Sony A90J OLED is an amazing 4k TV from Sony's Master Series. Like other OLEDs, it delivers unparalleled picture quality thanks to its self-emitting pixels, which produce perfect blacks and a near-infinite contrast ratio. While its HDR brightness is only decent relative to LED TVs, it still delivers a great HDR experience thanks to its wide color gamut and high contrast ratio. It also has a near-instantaneous response time for clear motion, but some gamers may be disappointed by the lack of variable refresh rate (VRR) support, even though itâ€™s set to arrive with a future firmware update.</p>
